To do that and to unlock Europe’s growth potential, we must activate the supply of capital and develop deeper capital markets in Europe.  We need to understand the frictions that can preclude firms from borrowing money or rolling over debt. Similarly, we need to understand the frictions that prevent them from raising equity.

Recent crises, such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis or the dash-for-cash in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic have demonstrated that lack of access to debt or equity markets negatively impacts firm investment, employment and growth. Answers to these questions can facilitate firms’ access to funding and guide policy makers to determine avoid and optimal respond to future funding crises.
